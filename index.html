<h1>BIGGEST HEADER</h1>
<p>This is the first paragraph. It is directly tied to the <i><b>BIGGEST HEADER</b></i>, and it's supposed to be the <mark>main body of the general body.</mark> Everything written here is to form a paragraph.</p>
<p>You can add as many paragraphs as you wish to.</p>
<p><i>Really.</i></p>
<p>But the paragraph itself cannot be divided without the help of<br>
A break! (This is still the paragraph. <i>The <b>fourth</b> one! I know!! Fckn insane!!!!)</i></p>

<h2>THIS IS A BIG (BUT NOT THE BIGGEST) HEADER</h2>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue"> This is a paragraph. It's blue, because making a website is magic. All you need is <i>style.</i></p> 
	<p style="color:Gray"><small><del>(Or the dark arts of manipulating virgin souls. Whatever helps. Coding's hard.)</del></small></p>
<p style="font-size: 80px">SIZE!</p>

<table style="width:300px">
	<tr>
		<th>This</th>
		<th>is</th>
		<th>something</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>else</th>
		<th>you</th>
		<th>can do!</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> I FCKN</th>
		<th>LOVE</th>
		<th><b>TABLES</b></th>
	</tr>
